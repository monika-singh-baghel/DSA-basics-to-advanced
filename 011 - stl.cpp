/*STL stands for standard template library which contains a lot of pre-defined templates in terms of containers and classes which makes it very
easy for programmers to implement different data structures easily without having to write complete code and worry about space-time complexities.*/

/*1. Unordered set:- a container that stores unique elements in no particular order. Every operation on an unordered set takes O(1) complexity in the 
average case and takes O(n) in the worst case.*/
